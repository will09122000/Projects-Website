        "a": "Discord is a free communication platform that lets you chat in both text and voice calls. It also allows creating and using Discord server bots â€“ automated users that perform actions assigned to them by the developer.",
        "b": "This bot provides various commands and features for both admins and users of selected Discord Servers, these Servers are all part of an online sim-racing community known as EERC (European E-Racing Community). It is programmed in JavaScript and runs in Node.js. Below are just a few examples of what this bot is able to do.",
        "Reminders": "Reminders can be set for someone else in the server or yourself, the user is then notified with the message after the pre-determined delay. It is also possible to notify a user at a certain time of day (e.g 14:00).",
        "Weather": "The Weather can play a large part in an online race, it can be advantageous to know the weather beforehand. Therefore, we needed a fair and slightly random way of configuring the weather settings for a race. This command uses the percentage chance of rain during the race along with an element of randomness to output the weather settings for the race, this weather can include: clear skies, light cloud, overcast, light rain and rain.",
        "Stats": "This command displays statistics on the user's activity on all servers with the bot. The first picture shows their average number of messages sent on each day of the week on each server. The second displays their average number of messages sent each hour of the day on each server. Lastly, the third displays the top 10 chat channels the user is active in.",
        "Roles": "Discord Roles enable you to categorise and set permissions for users in the server. For example, British users get the British role. These commands below allow the user to assign their own roles rather than an admin assigning it, this is especially useful in larger servers with lots of people wanting various roles.",
        "TTS": "Using Google's text to speech API, this bot will read aloud messages to users in a voice channel. This is used when penalties are announced to those driving during an online endurance race."

A random letter depending on their input is added to a list using the same probability distribution from the Countdown show.  The 9 letters for this function will be returned as a string.",
          "c": "A list of words is created from 'words.txt' with punctuation removed and words less than 10 letters long. The argument for this function is expected to be the name of a text file as a string. The words will then be returned as a list.",
          "d": "The next function will take the 9 letter string and return two lists. The first being all possible words that can be made from those 9 letters and the second being the longest words that can be made.",
          "e": "The last main function asks the user to input their best guess as well as being given the chance to shuffle the letters. Their input is checked against all possible words to see if there is a match. If there is the program will print out: the number of points scored, statistics on how 'good' their word was, if they scored maximum points and lastly a list of the longest words.",
          "WDIL": "As this was the first programming coursework, the actual python code and overal logic of the program was relatively simple. However, it did teach me how to format code correctly using a pre-determined style. This included documentation such as comments and doc strings."

The user is notified when an alarm is up via an alarm sound, text to speech and a notification which is displayed in the notifications column. The user is also notified when the weather in the location selected has changed and when there is a new news story. The web page will automatically refresh every 5 minutes to keep the notifications, weather and news up to date on screen.",

First, they can select days of the week for the alarm to repeat on. Secondly, an alarm label which is displayed in notifications and read out to the user when the alarm goes off along with an alarm sound. The alarm is also logged when it goes off along with the appropriate data. The user edit the time of a regular alarm or repeating alarm once it's been set and delete alarms.",

This data is then displayed on the main page. A notification is sent each time weather has been fetched and some data has changed, this is also logged. The user can change the location of the weather with the name of a Town or City.",

Tthe lift starts from the bottom floor and continually travels to the top floor and back down to the ground floor, picking up requests if they are heading the same direction as the lift and the lift is not full. Each time a floor is reached, those requests inside the lift who's destination is the current floor are removed from the lift.",
          "Improved_Algorithm": "For the improved algorithm, the lift starts from the bottom floor. While there are no requests on any floor or in the lift, the lift will travel to the middle floor and wait there for requests to be in the optimal position pending a new request on a random floor. When a request spawns and the lift is empty, the lift will travel to the request that has been waiting the longest picking up any requests heading in the same direction as the lift. The lift will then travel to the destination floor of that request also picking up any heading in the same direction as the lift.",
